**Muya** originated from [MarkText](https://github.com/marktext/marktext), which was originally used in the MarkText and provides Markdown editing support for MarkText. Today, Muya is available as a stand-alone library that provides an efficient Markdown editing experience for many web browser applications.

:a: Muya is still under development and should not be used for production.

## FAQ

❓ **What is the relationship between MarkText and Muya?**

Muya is derived from MarkText. Our team believes that Muya should not be limited to desktop applications. It should also run in a web browser, so we have done some compatibility with browsers and Electron applications, so that Muya can leave Electron Apps and can run into different browser environments.

❓**What is the relationship between MarkText's version and the Muya's version?**

None!
